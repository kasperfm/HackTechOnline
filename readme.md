## About HackTech Online

HackTech Online is a semi-realistic hacking simulation game, set in a near cyberpunk like future.
All you need is a web browser, to be able to play with people from all around the world!

In HackTech Online no player is safe, and no firewall is good enough! You take part in the game as yourself, and have the option to fight against the bad guys on the net, or join them... Join or create a corporation with other players, and start your PvP hacking career. Or choose to complete missions for underground groups, big corporations or secret government agencies.
You will soon be able to conquer the net!

## Who made this?

The game is made by me, Kasper FÃ¦rch Mikkelsen (https://kasperfm.com).
HTO is my "little child" that I have been working on for a long time. In the beginning I used it to learn PHP and Javascript, but as time passed I rewrote it a couple of times. Now the game is made with Laravel 8.x (started as Laravel 5.5), and this is probably the last version of the game I will make.
